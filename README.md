# Introduction
Focusing on data and data analyst roles, then let's take a deep look into the job market. This project explores jobs with top salaries, in-demand skills, and where high skill demand meets high salaries.

If you want to see the SQL queries, take a look here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
Curious to see and understand in-demand skills in the data analyst job market, both nationally and in Michigan, to create an effective job search strategy, this project was created to identify demanded skills and top salaries, which will help job seekers build a strategy toward optimal jobs.

The origin of the data for this project comes from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql).

### Questions that I wanted to answer via SQL queries within the project:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs on a national and state of Michigan level?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. What skills are connected to high-end salaries on a national level and in Michigan?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn overall and in Michigan?

# Tools
With several key tools, I leaped into the data analyst job market, wielding the power of the following:

- **SQL**: As the backbone of this project, I used it for analysis, allowing me to query the database to unveil meaningful insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: This was the database management system
 used for its efficient organization and management of job posting data.
 - **Visual Studio Code**: my integrated development environment (IDE) used for database management and running SQL queries.
 - **Git and GitHub**: Used for its robust version control and for sharing my SQL scripts.

# The Method/Analysis
Geared toward investigating the data analyst job market in this project, here is how I approached each question by using queries:

### 1. High-end Salary for Data Analyst Jobs
To uncover the highest paying roles, I filtered for data analyst roles by yearly average salary and job location, focusing on remote jobs or Michigan jobs. This query shows high salary opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    cd.name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jpf
    LEFT JOIN company_dim AS cd
    ON jpf.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short LIKE '%Data Analyst%'
    AND (job_location = 'Anywhere' OR job_location LIKE '%MI')
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here are the detailed insights from the query result-set.

The companies are ranked from highest to lowest average salary.
**AT&T** appears at the top, suggesting it offers the most competitive salary for Data Analyst roles among the companies listed.

The chart provides a quick comparison of salary ranges among leading companies, useful for understanding market standards and identifying employers that value data analysis skills highly.
